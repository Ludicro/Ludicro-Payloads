# Ludicro-BadUSB
This is a collection of my scripts, primarily used for Flipper Zero BadUSB.

NOTE: I did not create every script in this repo, the comment header in each script should silll have the original author. If it does not say Ludicro, then it is not mine, all credit is due to the original author(s).

# DuckyScript v1.0
The .xml file DuckyScript.xml is a language file for Notepad++ to make writing in DuckyScript a little easier to read. 

It is case sensitive, though when actually implementing these scripts, it does not matter unless you are typing a string.
REM is colored green for comments
Keywords:
	Red: Universal among different operating systems
	Blue: Primarily PC and Mac keys (CTRL, SHIFT, etc.)
